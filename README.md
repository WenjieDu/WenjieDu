üëã Hi, I'm Wenjie Du (ÊùúÊñáÊù∞ in Chinese). My research majors in modeling time series with machine learning,
especially partially-observed time series (POTS), namely, incomplete time series with missing values,
A.K.A. irregularly-sampled time series. I strongly advocate open-source and reproducible research, 
and I always devote myself to building my work into valuable real-world applications.
Unix philosophy *"Do one thing and do it well"* is also my life philosophy, and I always strive to walk my talk.
My research goal is to model this non-trivial and kaleidoscopic world with machine learning to make it a better place for everyone.
It's my honor if my work could help you in any way.

ü§î POTS is ubiquitous in the real world and is vital to AI landing in the industry. However, 
it still lacks attention from academia and is also in short of a dedicated toolkit even in a community as vast as Python.
Hence, we're leading <ins>**the project PyPOTS**</ins> on GitHub (including the repos [PyPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS),
[BrewPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/BrewPOTS), [TSDB](https://github.com/WenjieDu/TSDB),
and [PyGrinder](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyGrinder)) to facilitate our researchers and engineers' work
related to POTS. If your interests lie in this field, our work may be useful to you and
***I sincerely invite you to follow me on GitHub and join [our community](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS#-community)ü§ù.*** 
Stars on our reposüåü are also very welcome of course if you like what we're trying to achieve with PyPOTS.

üí¨ I'm open to questions related to my research and always try my best to help others.
I love questioning myself and I never stop. If you have questions for discussion or have interests in collaboration,
please feel free to drop me an email or ping me on LinkedIn/WeChat/Slack (<ins>**contact info is at the top**</ins>) üòÉ  
**Note that I'm very glad to help review papers related to my research, but ONLY for open-source ones with readable code.**

‚ù§Ô∏è If you enjoy what I do, you can [fund me and become a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/WenjieDu).
And I assure you that every penny from sponsorships will be used to support impactful open-science research.

üòä Thank you for reading my profile.
