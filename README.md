👋 Hi, I'm Wenjie Du (杜文杰 in Chinese). My research majors in modeling time series with machine learning, <ins>especially partially-observed time series (POTS), namely, incomplete time series with missing values, A.K.A. irregularly-sampled time series</ins>. I strongly advocate **open-source and reproducible research**, and I always devote myself to building my work into valuable real-world applications.

🤔 POTS is ubiquitous in real-world modeling. This field is vital to AI landing in the industry, however, it still lacks attention from academia and is also in short of a dedicated toolkit even in a community as vast as Python. Therefore, I'm leading some open-source projects on GitHub (e.g. [PyPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS) and [TSDB](https://github.com/WenjieDu/TSDB)) to facilitate other researchers and engineers' work related to POTS. If your interests lie in this field, my work probably is very useful to you! **So, <ins>I sincerely invite you to follow me on GitHub and join the community of PyPOTS 🤝</ins>**

💬 I am open to questions related to my research and always try my best to help others. I love questioning myself and I never stop.
