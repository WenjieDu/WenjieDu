👋 Hi, I'm Wenjie Du (杜文杰 in Chinese). My research majors in modeling time series with machine learning, especially partially-observed time series (POTS), namely, incomplete time series with missing values, A.K.A. irregularly-sampled time series. I strongly advocate open-source and reproducible research, and I always devote myself to building my work into valuable real-world applications.

🤔 POTS is ubiquitous in real-world modeling. This field is vital to AI landing in the industry, however, it still lacks attention from academia and is also in short of a dedicated toolkit even in a community as vast as Python. Therefore, I'm leading some open-source projects on GitHub (e.g. [PyPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS) and [TSDB](https://github.com/WenjieDu/TSDB)) to facilitate other researchers and engineers' work related to POTS. If your interests lie in this field, my work probably is very useful to you! **So, I sincerely invite you to follow me on GitHub and join the [community of PyPOTS](https://join.slack.com/t/pypots-dev/shared_invite/zt-1gq6ufwsi-p0OZdW~e9UW_IA4_f1OfxA)🤝.** Stars on our repo🌟 are also very welcome of course if you like what we're trying to achieve with PyPOTS.<a href='https://github.com/WenjieDu/TSDB'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WenjieDu/TSDB/main/docs/figs/TSDB%20logo.svg?sanitize=true" align='right' width='230'></a>

💬 I'm open to questions related to my research and always try my best to help others. I love questioning myself and I never stop. If you have questions for discussion or have interests in collaboration, please feel free to drop me an email or ping me on LinkedIn/WeChat/Slack (contact info is at the top) 😃

😊 Thank you for reading my profile.
