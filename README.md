Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Wenjie Du. My research majors in modeling time series, especially partially-observed <br>time series (POTS), namely, incomplete time series with missing values. I <ins>strongly advocate</ins> <br>**open-source and reproducible research**.

POTS is everywhere in open-world modeling, however, this field still lacks attention from <br>academia and is also in short of a dedicated toolkit even in a community as vast as Python. <br>Therefore, I'm now working on two open-source projects ([PyPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS) and [TSDB](https://github.com/WenjieDu/Time_Series_Database)) to facilitate <br>other researchers and engineers' work related to POTS. If your interests lie in this field, please <br>**follow me** ðŸ‘€. I believe my work will be very useful to you!

I am open to questions about POTS modeling and always try my best to help others. If you have questions for discussion or have interests in collaboration, please feel free to [drop me an email](mailto:wenjay.du@gmail.com) or PM me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wenjie-du/) / [WeChat](https://github.com/PyPOTS/PyPOTS/blob/7e4c0f3acc047c62e46ef5b48d3e5b1d0f5ed236/docs/figs/Wechat_WDU.jpg)! ðŸ˜ƒ
