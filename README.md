üëã Hi, I'm Wenjie Du (ÊùúÊñáÊù∞ in Chinese). My research majors in modeling time series with machine learning,
especially partially-observed time series (POTS), namely, incomplete time series with missing values,
A.K.A. irregularly-sampled time series. I strongly advocate open-source and reproducible research, 
and I always devote myself to building my work into valuable real-world applications.
Unix philosophy *"Do one thing and do it well"* is also my life philosophy, and I always strive to walk my talk.
My research goal is to model this non-trivial and kaleidoscopic world with machine learning to make it a better place for everyone.
It's my honor if my work could help you in any way.

ü§î POTS is ubiquitous in the real world and is vital to AI landing in the industry. However, 
it still lacks attention from academia and is also in short of a dedicated toolkit even in a community as vast as Python.
Therefore, to facilitate our researchers and engineers' work related to POTS, I'm leading <a href="https://pypots.com"><img src="https://pypots.com/figs/pypots_logos/PyPOTS/logo_FFBG.svg" width="30px" align="center"/> <b>PyPOTS Research</b> (pypots.com)</a>
to build a comprehensive Python toolkit ecosystem for POTS modeling, including data preprocessing, neural net training, and benchmarking.
Starsüåü on our repos are also very welcome of course if you like what we're trying to achieve with PyPOTS.

ü§ñ Furthermore, to rescue human beings from the tedious and time-consuming work of mass time series analysis, we are building state-of-the-art
<a href="https://time-series.ai"><img src="https://pypots.com/figs/misc/robot.svg" width="26px" align="center"/> <b>Time-Series AI</b> (time-series.ai)</a>
for time series multitask end-to-end learning (classification, forecasting, clustering, anomaly detection),
data reconstruction (A.K.A. cleaning, repairing, imputation), and data generation for privacy protection and data augmentation,
which will be available soon! We also provide consulting services and tailored AI for companies and organizations that need help with time series analysis and applications.

üí¨ I'm open to questions related to my research and always try my best to help others.
I love questioning myself and I never stop. If you have questions for discussion or have interests in collaboration,
please feel free to drop me an email or ping me on LinkedIn/WeChat/Slack (<ins>**contact info is at the top**</ins>) üòÉ
You can follow me on Google Scholar and GitHub to get notified of our latest publications and open-source projects.
**Note that I'm very glad to help review papers related to my research, but ONLY for open-source ones with readable code.**
