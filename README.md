ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Wenjie Du. My research majors in modeling time series with machine learning, especially partially-observed time series (POTS), namely, incomplete time series with missing values. And I **strongly advocate** <ins>open-source and reproducible research</ins>.

<a href='https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS/main/docs/figs/PyPOTS%20logo.svg?sanitize=true' width='150' align='left' /></a>

ðŸ¤” POTS is everywhere in open-world modeling, however, this field still lacks attention from academia and is also in short of a dedicated toolkit even in a community as vast as Python. Therefore, I'm currently working on two open-source projects ([PyPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS) and [TSDB](https://github.com/WenjieDu/Time_Series_Database)) to facilitate other researchers and engineers' work related to POTS. If your interests lie in this field, my work may be very useful to you!
