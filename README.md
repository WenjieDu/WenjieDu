👋 Hi, I'm Wenjie Du. My research majors in modeling time series with machine learning, especially <ins>partially-observed time series (POTS), namely, incomplete time series with missing values</ins>. And I strongly advocate open-source and reproducible research.

🤔 POTS is everywhere in open-world modeling. This field is vital to AI landing in the real world, however, it still lacks attention from academia and is also in short of a dedicated toolkit even in a community as vast as Python. Therefore, I'm leading some open-source projects on GitHub ([PyPOTS](https://github.com/WenjieDu/PyPOTS) and [TSDB](https://github.com/WenjieDu/Time_Series_Database)) to facilitate other researchers and engineers' work related to POTS. If your interests lie in this field, my work probably will be very useful to you! **So, 🤝 please follow me on GitHub and join the community of PyPOTS❗️**
